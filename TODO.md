TODO 

my-website-codewars/ed_fatchild -> Stylized image

ULTIMATE PLAN
[ ] - A website which has a bunch of options to build the api call i.e. image


NEXT STEP 
[ ] - Find some technologies to support this projects
        - https://www.npmjs.com/package/html-to-image
[ ] - Route from the arguments to save an image
[ ] - Image caching
[ ] - Rate limiting


NOTES
1. Router gets api?username=user_name&some_other=params
    a. check if we already have a corresponding cached image
2. Make a request to codewars for the JSON information
3. Create an image from html using the npm lib, save the image to disk caching it
4. Serve that image up
